<DIR><STRONG>Description:</STRONG>
<DIR><STRONG>Abstract:</STRONG>Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is the terminology 
adopted by the USGS to describe terrain elevation data sets in a digital raster 
form. The standard DEM consists of a regular array of elevations cast on a 
designated coordinate projection system. The DEM data are stored as a series of 
profiles in which the spacing of the elevations along and between each profile 
is in regular whole number intervals. The normal orientation of data is by 
columns and rows. Each column contains a series of elevations ordered from south 
to north with the order of the columns from west to east. The DEM is formatted 
as one ASCII header record (A-record), followed by a series of profile records 
(B-records) each of which include a short B-record header followed by a series 
of ASCII integer elevations per each profile. The last physical record of the 
DEM is an accuracy record (C-record). 7.5-minute DEM (30- by 30-meter data 
spacing, cast on Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection). Provides 
coverage in 7.5- by 7.5-minute blocks. Each product provides the same coverage 
as a standard USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle without over edge. Coverage is for the 
Contiguous United States, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. </DIR>
<DIR><STRONG>Purpose:</STRONG>DEM's can be used as source data for digital 
orthophotos, and, as layers in geographic information systems, for earth science 
analysis. DEM's can also serve as tools for volumetric analysis, for site 
location of towers, or for drainage basin delineation. These data were collected 
as part of the National Mapping Program. </DIR>
<DIR><STRONG>Supplemental Information:</STRONG>7.5-minute DEM's have rows and 
columns which vary in length and are staggered. The UTM bounding coordinates 
form a quadrilateral (no two sides are parallel to each other), rather than a 
rectangle. The user will need to pad out the uneven rows and columns with blanks 
or flagged data values, if a rectangle is required for the user's application. 
Some software vendors have incorporated this function into their software for 
input of standard formatted USGS DEMs. </DIR></DIR>

<DIR><STRONG>Data Quality Information:</STRONG>
<DIR><STRONG>Attribute Accuracy:</STRONG>
<DIR><STRONG>Attribute Accuracy Report:</STRONG>The accuracy of a DEM is 
dependent upon the level of detail of the source and the grid spacing used to 
sample that source. The primary limiting factor for the level of detail of the 
source is the scale of the source materials. The proper selection of grid 
spacing determines the level of content that may be extracted from a given 
source during digitization. </DIR></DIR>
<DIR><STRONG>Logical Consistency Report:</STRONG>The fidelity of the 
relationships encoded in the data structure of the DEM are automatically 
verified using a USGS software program upon completion of the data production 
cycle. The test verifies full compliance to the DEM specification.</DIR>
<DIR><STRONG>Completeness Report:</STRONG>The DEM is visually inspected for 
completeness on a DEM view and edit system for the purpose of performing a final 
quality control and if necessary edit of the DEM. The physical format of each 
digital elevation model is validated for content completeness and logical 
consistency during production quality control and prior to archiving in the 
National Digital Cartographic Data Base. Due to the variable orientation of the 
quadrilateral in relation to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection 
grid, profiles that pass within the bounds of the DEM quadrilateral, may be void 
of elevation grid points, and are not represented in the DEM. This condition 
occurs infrequently and is always the first or last profile of the dataset. 
Level 2 DEM: Level 2 DEM's may contain void areas due to interruptions to 
contours in the source graphic or DLG. Void area elevation grid posts are 
assigned the value of -32,767. In addition, suspect elevation areas may exist in 
the DEM but are not specifically identified. Suspect areas can be located on the 
source graphic as a "disturbed surface, " symbolized by contours overprinted 
with photorevised or other surface patterns. </DIR>
<DIR><STRONG>Positional Accuracy:</STRONG>
<DIR><STRONG>Horizontal Positional Accuracy:</STRONG>
<DIR><STRONG>Horizontal Positional Accuracy Report:</STRONG>The horizontal 
accuracy of the DEM is expressed as an estimated root mean square error (RMSE). 
The estimate of the RMSE is based upon horizontal accuracy tests of the DEM 
source materials which are selected as equal to or less than intended horizontal 
RMSE error of the DEM. The testing of horizontal accuracy of the source 
materials isaccomplished by comparing the planimetric (X and Y) coordinates of 
well-defined ground points with the coordinates of the same points as determined 
from a source of higher accuracy.</DIR></DIR>
<DIR><STRONG>Vertical Positional Accuracy:</STRONG>
<DIR><STRONG>Vertical Positional Accuracy Report:</STRONG>The vertical RMSE 
statistic is used to describe the vertical accuracy of a DEM, encompassing both 
random and systematic errors introduced during production of the data. The RMSE 
is encoded in element number 5 of record C of the DEM. Accuracy is computed by a 
comparison of linear interpolated elevations in the DEM with corresponding known 
elevations. Test points are well distributed, representative of the terrain, and 
have true elevations with accuracies well within the DEM accuracy criteria. 
Acceptable test points include, in order of preference: field control, 
aerotriangulated test points, spot elevations, or points on contours from 
existing source maps with appropriate contour interval. A minimum of 28 test 
points per DEM is required to compute the RMSE, which is composed of a single 
test using 20 interior points and 8 edge points. Edge points are those which are 
located along, at, or near the quadrangle neatlines and are deemed by the editor 
to be useful to evaluating the accuracy of the edge of the DEM. Collection of 
test point data and comparison of the DEM with the quadrangle hypsography are 
conducted by the quality control units within the USGS. There are three types of 
DEM vertical errors; blunder, systematic and random. These errors are reduced in 
magnitude by editing but cannot be completely eliminated. Blunder errors are 
those errors of major proportions and are easily identified and removed during 
interactive editing. Systematic errors are those errors that follow some fixed 
pattern and are introduced by data collection procedures and systems. These 
error artifacts include: vertical elevation shifts, misinterpretation of terrain 
surface due to trees, buildings and shadows, and fictitious ridges, tops, 
benches or striations. Random errors result from unknown or accidental causes. 
DEM's are edited to correctly depict elevation surfaces that correspond to water 
bodies of specified size. Level 1 DEM: A RMSE of 7-meters or less is the desired 
accuracy standard. A RMSE of 15-meters is the maximum permitted. A 7.5-minute 
DEM at this level has an absolute elevation error tolerance of 50 meters 
(approximately three times the 15-meter RMSE) for blunder errors for any grid 
node when compared to the true elevation. Any array of points in the DEM can not 
encompass more than 49 contiguous elevations in error by more than 21 meters 
(three times the 7-meter RMSE). Systematic errors that are within stated 
accuracy standards are tolerated. Level 2 DEM: A vertical RMSE of one-half of 
the contour interval, determined by the source map, is the maximum permitted. 
Systematic errors may not exceed one contour interval, determined by the source 
map, is the maximum permitted. Systematic errors may not exceed one contour 
interval specified by the source graphic. Level 2 DEMs have been processed or 
smoothed for consistency and edited to remove identifiable systematic 
errors.</DIR></DIR></DIR>

<DIR><STRONG>Process Step:</STRONG>
<DIR><STRONG>Process Description:</STRONG>The production procedures, 
instrumentation, hardware and software used in the collection of standard U.S. 
Geological Survey Digital Elevation Models (DEM's) vary depending on systems 
used at the contractor, cooperator or National Mapping Division (NMD) production 
sites. This process step describes, in general, the process used in the 
production of standard USGS DEM datasets. Level 1 DEM: Level 1 DEM's are 
acquired photogrammetrically by manual profiling or image correlation techniques 
from National Aerial Photography Program (NAPP) or equivalent source 
photographs. Level 1 30-minute DEM's may be derived or resampled from level 1 
7.5-minute DEM's. Level 2 DEM: Level 2 DEM's are produced by converting 
1:24,000-scale and 1:100,000-scale hypsography digital line graph (DLG) data to 
DEM format or the DEM's are generated from vector data derived from scanned 
raster files of USGS 1:24,000-scale or 1:100,000-scale map series contour 
separates. Level 3 DEM: Level 3 DEM's are created from DLG data that has been 
vertically integrated with all categories of hypsography, hydrography, ridge 
line, break line, drain files and all vertical and horizontal control networks. 
The production of level 3 DEM's requires a system of logic incorporated into the 
software interpolation algorithms that clearly differentiates and correctly 
interpolates between the various types of terrain, data densities and data 
distribution. Water Body Editing: DEM surface areas corresponding to water 
bodies are flattened and assigned map specified or estimated surface elevations. 
Water body areas are defined as ponds, lakes, and reservoirs that exceed 0.5 
inches at map scale and double line drainage that exceeds 0.25 inches at map 
scale. Water body shorelines are derived either from a hypsographic DLG or by 
interactive delineation from 1:24,000-scale or 1:100,000-scale USGS map series. 
Edge Matching: DEM datasets within a project area (consisting of a number of 
adjacent files) are edge matched to assure terrain surface continuity between 
files. Edge matching is the process of correcting adjacent elevation values 
along common edges. The objective of edge matching is to create more accurate 
terrain representations by correcting the alignment of ridges and drains, and 
overall topographic shaping within an approximately 25-30 row or column grid 
post zone on both edges. Quality Control: DEM's are viewed on interactive 
editing systems to identify and correct blunder and systematic errors. DEM's are 
verified for physical format and logical consistency at the production centers 
and before archiving in the National Digital Cartographic Data Base (NDCDB) 
utilizing the Digital Elevation Model Verification System (DVS) software. </DIR>
